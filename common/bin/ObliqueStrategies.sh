# Oblique strategies is a set of cards created to break deadlocks in creative
# situations. This script randomly "draws" a card from the deck.
#
# OBLIQUE STRATEGIES
# Over 100 worthwhile dilemmas by Brian Eno & Peter Schmidt
#
#  These cards evolved from our separate observations of the principles
#  underlying what we were doing.  Sometimes they were recognized in retro-
#  spect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they were formulated.
#  They can be used as a pack (a set of possibilities being continuously
#  reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack
#  when a dilemma occurs in a working situation.  In this case the card is
#  trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear.  They are not final,
#  as new ideas will present themselves, and others will become self-evident.
