'''This script is designed to sychronize the color of the system's RGB colors with
the temperature of the system sensors, as reported by lm_sensors, every N seconds

Dependencies:
- lm_sensors installed and the "sensors" CLI available
- OpenRGB installed and the server running
- py3nvml
- openrgb-python

Notes:
- GPU temperature "load" at 50C and "utilized" at 75C
- k10temp CPU readings "load" at 45 and "utilized" at 55
- nvme-100 "load" at 45 and "utilized" at 55
- nvme-400 "load" at 40 and "utilized" at 45 (this one is well cooled constantly and probably isn't a concern)
